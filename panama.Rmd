# Panama Paperes


The Panama Papers are 11.5 million leaked documents that detail financial and attorney-client information for 213.634 offshore entities. The documents were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source.

Those involved contracted with the law firm, Mossack Fonseca, consultants for companies, services consisting in founding and establishing companies registered in a tax haven in such a way that they fulfilled the primary objective of hiding the identity of the owners.

The involved ones hired the Mossack Fonseca firm as consultors trying to make buys in tax heavens occulting the identity of the owners.

The total size of the archives is about 2,6 TeraBytes.

```


#Data sets


The data set we used for the analysis was taken from [OFFSHORE LEAKS DATABASE](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database) by The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.


*"The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists is a global network of more than 190 investigative journalists in more than 65 countries who collaborate on in-depth investigative stories."*


The data set is composed by five `.csv` files:

* **Edges:** `panama_papers.edges.csv`
* **Addresses:** `panama_papers.nodes.address.csv`
* **Entity nodes:** `panama_papers.nodes.entity.csv`
* **Intermediary nodes:** `panama_papers.nodes.intermediary.csv`
* **Officer nodes:** `panama_papers.nodes.officer.csv`

On the other hand, it was powered by [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) a graph database that structures data in nodes. The data base follows the following structure:


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
#Thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36350213/how-to-insert-plain-picture-jpeg-png-from-chunk-with-knitr?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa
#and https://www.lyonwj.com/2017/11/28/geocoding-paradise-papers-neo4j-spatial-visualization/
knitr::include_graphics('datamodel.jpg')
```


As we see in this diagram provided by [Lyonwj](https://www.lyonwj.com/2017/11/28/geocoding-paradise-papers-neo4j-spatial-visualization/) there are three **Entity** ("Address", "Officer", "Entity") and the **Relationships** are stored in an edges data base. According to the *Entity-Relationship model*.

We also used a `.geo.json` file for the interactive map provided by [GeoJSON-maps](https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/) with information about location and demographic aspect of each country.

* **GeoJSON:** `customworld.geo.json`


#Importing and Exploring


For importing the `.csv` files we use the `read_csv()` function from the **readr** package.

```{r}
#Importing Edges
edges <- read_csv("panama_papers.edges.csv", col_types = cols(
  START_ID = col_character(),
  TYPE = col_factor(levels = c("intermediary_of", "officer_of", "registered_address")),
  END_ID = col_character(),
  link = col_character(),
  start_date = col_date(format = "%d-%b-%Y"), #Example of date format: 04-OCT-1994
  end_date = col_date(format = "%d-%b-%Y"),
  sourceID = col_character(),
  valid_until = col_character()
  )
)

#Importing Nodes
nodes_officer <- read_csv("panama_papers.nodes.officer.csv", col_types = cols(
  node_id = col_character(),
  name = col_character(),
  country_codes = col_character(),
  countries = col_character(),
  sourceID = col_character(),
  valid_until = col_character(),
  note = col_character()
  )
)
nodes_address <- read_csv("panama_papers.nodes.address.csv", col_types = cols(
  node_id = col_character(),
  name = col_character(),
  address = col_character(),
  country_codes = col_character(),
  countries = col_character(),
  sourceID = col_character(),
  valid_until = col_character(),
  note = col_character()
  )
)
nodes_entity <- read_csv("panama_papers.nodes.entity.csv", col_types = cols(
  node_id = col_character(),
  name = col_character(),
  jurisdiction = col_character(),
  jurisdiction_description = col_character(),
  country_codes = col_character(),
  countries = col_character(),
  incorporation_date = col_date(format = "%d-%b-%Y"),
  inactivation_date = col_date(format = "%d-%b-%Y"),
  struck_off_date = col_date(format = "%d-%b-%Y"),
  closed_date = col_date(format = "%d-%b-%Y"),
  ibcRUC = col_character(),
  status = col_factor(levels = c("Active", "Shelf company", "Defaulted",  "Dissolved shelf company", "Trash company", "Changed agent", "Dissolved")),
  company_type = col_character(),
  service_provider = col_character(),
  sourceID = col_character(),
  valid_until = col_character(),
  note = col_character()
  )
)
nodes_intermediary <- read_csv("panama_papers.nodes.intermediary.csv",  col_types = cols(
  node_id = col_character(),
  name = col_character(),
  country_codes = col_character(),
  countries = col_character(),
  status = col_factor(levels = c("ACTIVE", "SUSPENDED", "CLIENT IN REPRESENTATIVE TERRITORY", "DELINQUENT", "INACTIVE", "UNRECOVERABLE ACCOUNTS")),
  sourceID = col_character(),
  valid_until = col_character(),
  note = col_character()
  ) 
)
```

For the `.geo.json` file we use the `geojson_read()` from the **geojsonio** package, with the `what` argument equal to *"sp"*.

```{r}
#Importing map data thanks to https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/
world_map <- geojsonio::geojson_read("customworld.geo.json", what = "sp")
```


##Edges


The Edges file keep the information about relationship between entity, officer, intermediaries and their addresses and is contained in the `panama_papers.edges.csv` file.

Using `glimpse()` function from **dplyr** package we display the structure of the imported files. We use `glimpse()` and not `str()` because the visualization looks cleaner.

```{r}
glimpse(edges)
```

As we see, this data frame has 8 variables and 674.102 observations. Variables are:

* `START_ID` is a **character** that show, using a code number, the starting node of the tides between two nodes of different type.
* `TYPE` is a **factor** that show the type of connection between the nodes. Possible values are "intermediary_of", "officer_of" and "registered_address".
* `END_ID` is an **character** that show, using a code number, the ending node of the tides between two nodes of different type.
* `link` is a **character** that describe the type of relationship between the nodes in a deep way.
* `start_date` starting **date** of the relationship. Most of the times is missing.
* `end_date` ending **date** of the relationship. Most of the times is missing.
* `sourceID` in these files the source is always *"Panama Papers"*.
* `valid_until` we do not know the meaning of this variable.

* `valid_until` we do not know the meaning of this variable.
* `note` possible notes.

Intermediaries are companies that NEXOS DE UNION ENTRE OTRAS COMPANIAS that means there are in two countries. That is why sometimes intermediaries are between two countries. This is not good for our analysis, so using **dplyr**, **stringr** and **rebus** packages we add half of the number of intermediaries to each country


##GeoJSON


This file contains all the necessary information for plot an interactive map plus demographic information, such as, population or GDP of every country.
It has a very complicated structure, so we are just going to display the structure of the data of each country (not the polygons).


```{r}
glimpse(world_map@data)
```


Still it is to much for explain every variable, that’s why we are just going to define the columns we will use in the future.

* `pop_est` is a **integer** with the estimate population of the country.
* `name` is a **factor** with the name of the country.
* `gdp_md_est` **is a double** with the estimate GDP of the country.
* `economy` is a **factor** with classify the country according with economic reasons.
* `iso_a3` is a **factor** that contain the code of the country. The code is composed by three letters.
* `continent` is a **factor** with the continent that the country belongs.

Using the internal variable `data` and **dplyr** we are able to add information into the GeoJSON object.

```{r}
#Adding variables to the JSON file

bad_countries <- full_join(bad_1, bad_2, by = c("V2" = "V3")) #Putting together

rm(bad_1, bad_2) #Cleaning

bad_countries[is.na(bad_countries)] <- 0 #Replacing NAs with 0s

bad <- bad_countries %>%
  mutate(n_int = n_int.x + n_int.y) %>%
  rename("country" = V2) %>%
  select(country , n_int) 

rm(bad_countries)

intermediary <- intermediary_all %>%
  full_join(bad, by = c("country_codes" = "country"))

intermediary[is.na(intermediary)] <- 0 #Replacing NAs with 0s

intermediary_all <- intermediary %>%
  mutate(n_int = n_int.x + n_int.y) %>%
  select(country_codes, n_int)



#JOINING data together
data_join <- data %>%
  left_join(entity, by = c("adm0_a3" = "country_codes")) %>%
  left_join(officer, by = c("adm0_a3" = "country_codes")) %>%
  left_join(intermediary_all, by = c("adm0_a3" = "country_codes"))

```


#Analysis Questions


Questions why will try to answer in this project:

* **First:** Which are the most involved countries in the Panama Papers?
* **Second:** Are developed countries are more involved into the Panama Papers than other countries?
* **Third:** 


# **First:** Which are the most involved countries in the Panama Papers?


First of all, we will analyses the nodes type one by one, country by country.


##Analysis


###Number of Entities.


Entities are maybe the most interesting "Entity" in this data set. The countries with more entities are Hong Kong, Switzerland, Panama, Jersey and Luxembourg, as we see in the following table.

```{r}
data_table <- data %>%
  select(name, adm0_a3, n_ent) %>%
  arrange(-n_ent) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  rename("Country" = name, "Code" = adm0_a3, "Number of Entities" = n_ent)
  
kable(data_table, caption = "Countries with more number of Entities")
```

In the following map we can see the distribution of the Entities all around the world.

```{r}
    #Configuring colours of the map
    pal <- colorBin("Oranges", domain = world_map$n_ent, bins = c(0, 10, 20, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, Inf))

    #Interactive labels
    labels <- sprintf("<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g entities",
                     world_map$name, world_map$n_ent) %>% 
    lapply(htmltools::HTML)

    #Ploting the map thanks to https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/
    leaflet(data = world_map) %>% 
      addTiles() %>%
      addPolygons(stroke = FALSE,
                fillColor = ~pal(n_ent), #Colours by number of cases
                fillOpacity = 0.7,
                highlight = highlightOptions( #Interactive Polygon
                    fillOpacity = 0.9,
                    bringToFront = TRUE),
                label = labels, #Interactive labels
                labelOptions = labelOptions( #Labels Options
                  style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
                  textsize = "15px",
                  direction = "auto")) %>%
      addLegend(pal = pal, 
              values = ~n_ent, 
              opacity = 0.7, 
              title = "Cases by country",
              position = "bottomright") %>%
      addEasyButton(easyButton( #Default View button
          icon="fa-globe", title="Default View",
          onClick=JS("function(btn, map){ map.setZoom(1); }"))) %>%
      setView(0,0,1)
```


In the following char we can see the distribution of entities by the status.


```{r}
plot <- as.data.frame(table(nodes_entity$status))

ggplot(plot, aes(x="", y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = " ",
    y = " ",
    fill = "Status",
    title = "Distribution of Entities by status") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_blank())
```

As we can see, most of the entities are in Defaulted status and more the 25% are still Active.

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(plot, col.names = c("Status", "Freq"))
```


### Number of Intermediaries.


As we see in the following table, the countries with more number of Intermediaries are Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Switzerland, United States and Panama. The number is double because an Intermediary can be two different countries at the same time.

```{r echo=FALSE}
data_table <- data %>%
  select(name, adm0_a3, n_int) %>%
  arrange(-n_int) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  rename("Country" = name, "Code" = adm0_a3, "Number of Intermediaries" = n_int)
  
kable(data_table, caption = "Countries with more number of Intermediaries")
```

In the following map we can see the distribution of the Intermediaries all around the world.

```{r echo=FALSE}
    #Configuring colours of the map
    pal <- colorBin("YlGn", domain = world_map$n_int, bins = c(0, 10, 20, 100, 200, 400, 700, 1000, Inf))

    #Interactive labels
    labels <- sprintf("<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g intermediaries",
                     world_map$name, world_map$n_int) %>% 
    lapply(htmltools::HTML)

    #Ploting the map thanks to https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/
    leaflet(data = world_map) %>% 
      addTiles() %>%
      addPolygons(stroke = FALSE,
                fillColor = ~pal(n_int), #Colours by number of cases
                fillOpacity = 0.7,
                highlight = highlightOptions( #Interactive Polygon
                    fillOpacity = 0.9,
                    bringToFront = TRUE),
                label = labels, #Interactive labels
                labelOptions = labelOptions( #Labels Options
                  style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
                  textsize = "15px",
                  direction = "auto")) %>%
      addLegend(pal = pal, 
              values = ~n_int, 
              opacity = 0.7, 
              title = "Cases by country",
              position = "bottomright") %>%
      addEasyButton(easyButton( #Default View button
          icon="fa-globe", title="Default View",
          onClick=JS("function(btn, map){ map.setZoom(1); }"))) %>%
      setView(0,0,1)
```


In the following char we can see the distribution of intermediaries by the status.


```{r echo=FALSE}
plot <- as.data.frame(table(nodes_intermediary$status))

ggplot(plot, aes(x="", y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = " ",
    y = " ",
    fill = "Status",
    title = "Distribution of Intermediaries by status") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_blank())
```

As we see, more than 50% of the Intermediaries are still ACTIVE and only 21 of them are considerate DELINQUENT.

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(plot, col.names = c("Status", "Freq"))
```


### Number of Officers.


Officers are real persons that own the entities or the intermediary firms.

```{r echo=FALSE}
data_table <- data %>%
  select(name, adm0_a3, n_off) %>%
  arrange(-n_off) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  rename("Country" = name, "Code" = adm0_a3, "Number of Officers" = n_off)
  
kable(data_table, caption = "Countries with more number of Officers")
```

In the following map we can see the distribution of the Officers all around the world.

```{r echo=FALSE}
    #Configuring colours of the map
    pal <- colorBin("Reds", domain = world_map$n_off, bins = c(0, 10, 20, 100, 200, 400, 700, 1000, Inf))

    #Interactive labels
    labels <- sprintf("<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g officers",
                     world_map$name, world_map$n_off) %>% 
    lapply(htmltools::HTML)

    #Ploting the map thanks to https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/
    leaflet(data = world_map) %>% 
      addTiles() %>%
      addPolygons(stroke = FALSE,
                fillColor = ~pal(n_off), #Colours by number of cases
                fillOpacity = 0.7,
                highlight = highlightOptions( #Interactive Polygon
                    fillOpacity = 0.9,
                    bringToFront = TRUE),
                label = labels, #Interactive labels
                labelOptions = labelOptions( #Labels Options
                  style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
                  textsize = "15px",
                  direction = "auto")) %>%
      addLegend(pal = pal, 
              values = ~n_off, 
              opacity = 0.7, 
              title = "Cases by country",
              position = "bottomright") %>%
      addEasyButton(easyButton( #Default View button
          icon="fa-globe", title="Default View",
          onClick=JS("function(btn, map){ map.setZoom(1); }"))) %>%
      setView(0,0,1)
```


###Total number of cases.


This is just a summation of the last three variables.

**cases = n_int + n_ent + n_off**

```{r echo=FALSE}
data_table <- data %>%
  select(name, adm0_a3, cases) %>%
  arrange(-cases) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  rename("Country" = name, "Code" = adm0_a3, "Number of cases" = cases)
  
kable(data_table, caption = "Countries with more number of cases")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
    #Configuring colours of the map
    pal <- colorBin("RdPu", domain = world_map$cases, bins = c(0, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 20000, Inf))

    #Interactive labels
    labels <- sprintf("<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g cases",
                     world_map$name, world_map$cases) %>% 
    lapply(htmltools::HTML)

    #Ploting the map thanks to https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/
    leaflet(data = world_map) %>% 
      addTiles() %>%
      addPolygons(stroke = FALSE,
                fillColor = ~pal(cases), #Colours by number of cases
                fillOpacity = 0.7,
                highlight = highlightOptions( #Interactive Polygon
                    fillOpacity = 0.9,
                    bringToFront = TRUE),
                label = labels, #Interactive labels
                labelOptions = labelOptions( #Labels Options
                  style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
                  textsize = "15px",
                  direction = "auto")) %>%
      addLegend(pal = pal, 
              values = ~cases, 
              opacity = 0.7, 
              title = "Cases by country",
              position = "bottomright") %>%
      addEasyButton(easyButton( #Default View button
          icon="fa-globe", title="Default View",
          onClick=JS("function(btn, map){ map.setZoom(1); }"))) %>%
      setView(0,0,1)
```


Number of cases can induce wrong conclusions because it is logical than countries with more people has more cases.


###Cases / Population.


In order to understand better the information, we create a new variable, `cases_pop` that has the result of:


**cases_pop = cases * 10000000 / pop_est**


Small countries with medium number of cases maybe are more involved than big countries with a little more cases.

This value helps us understand which country is more involved by Panama Papers.

According with this new parameter the most affected countries are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
data_table <- data %>%
  select(name, adm0_a3, cases_pop) %>%
  arrange(-cases_pop) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  rename("Country" = name, "Code" = adm0_a3, "Cases / Population" = cases_pop)
  
kable(data_table, caption = "Countries with more Cases / Population")
```

This map show the distribution all around the world of the parameter.

```{r echo=FALSE}
    #Configuring colours of the map
    pal <- colorBin("Blues", domain = world_map$cases_pop, bins = c(0, 10, 20, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, Inf))

    #Interactive labels
    labels <- sprintf("<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g cases*10(7) / people",
                     world_map$name, world_map$cases_pop) %>% 
    lapply(htmltools::HTML)

    #Ploting the map thanks to https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/
    leaflet(data = world_map) %>% 
      addTiles() %>%
      addPolygons(stroke = FALSE,
                fillColor = ~pal(cases_pop), #Colours by number of cases
                fillOpacity = 0.7,
                highlight = highlightOptions( #Interactive Polygon
                    fillOpacity = 0.9,
                    bringToFront = TRUE),
                label = labels, #Interactive labels
                labelOptions = labelOptions( #Labels Options
                  style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
                  textsize = "15px",
                  direction = "auto")) %>%
      addLegend(pal = pal, 
              values = ~cases_pop, 
              opacity = 0.7, 
              title = "Cases by country",
              position = "bottomright") %>%
      addEasyButton(easyButton( #Default View button
          icon="fa-globe", title="Default View",
          onClick=JS("function(btn, map){ map.setZoom(1); }"))) %>%
      setView(0,0,1)
```


##Conclusion


If we take into account just countries with more cases Hong Kong, Switzerland, China, Panama and Jersey are the most affected countries but as we see during the analysis `cases_pop` could be an interesting parameter as well for analyses of this question.

According to `cases_pop`, British Virgin Is., Niue, Jersey, Guernsey and Monaco are the most affected countries.

This make sense because we can see a lot of this countries in the **Top 10 tax havens** list on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_haven#Tax_haven_lists)

 * Ireland
 * Netherlands
 * United Kingdom
 * Singapore
 * Switzerland
 * Luxembourg
 * Hong Kong
 * Bermuda
 * Cayman Islands
 * British Virgin Islands
 
 Panama was recently removed from this list.


# **Second:** Are developed countries are more involved into the Panama Papers than other countries?

##Conclusion


As we see in the graphoc, there is an actual relationship between number of cases and GDP of the country but it is not very strong. 

It is true than countries with higher GDP values trend to have higher number of cases but is it not always like that and there are a lot of countries outside this trend.

This make sense, acording to [Dinero.com](https://www.dinero.com/economia/articulo/ranking-de-los-paises-que-mas-evaden-impuestos/245558) the [Onu-Winder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Institute_for_Development_Economics_Research) this is the list of the countries with more tax evasion.

*United States
*China
*Japon
*India
*France
*Germany
*Australia
*Spain
*South Korea
*United Kingdom

That match with the list of countries by GDP on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)) and confirm our analysis.

*United States
*European Union
*China
*Japon
*Germany
*United Kinddom
*France
*India
*Italy
*Brazil
*Canada


# **Third:** Which ones are the nodes?


##Analysis and conclusions.


As we will see during the analysis the Panama Papers network in huge, very complex and difficult to analyse that why the investigation of this data set is still on course and involved people from different areas and countries.

The five most influent nodes by node TYPE`s are:

```{r}
nodes_entity$type <- "Entity"
nodes_officer$type <- "Officer"
nodes_intermediary$type <- "Intermediary"
nodes_address$type <- "Address"

nodes <- bind_rows(nodes_entity, nodes_officer, nodes_intermediary, nodes_address)

start <- edges %>%
  select(START_ID, TYPE) %>%
  rename("node" = START_ID)

end <- edges %>%
  select(END_ID, TYPE) %>%
  rename("node" = END_ID)

edges_freq <- bind_rows(end, start)

rm(end, start)

freq <- edges_freq %>%
  group_by(node) %>%
  summarise(Freq = n())%>%
  inner_join(nodes, by =c("node" = "node_id"))%>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(type, node, name, countries, status, address, Freq)%>%
  group_by(type)%>%
  arrange(-Freq) %>%
  top_n(5)%>%
  arrange(type) %>%
  rename("Status" = status, "Countries" = countries)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(freq, caption = "Five more connected nodes of each edge TYPE")
```


### Node 14025646 (Address).


The node 14025646 is an address located in British Virgin Islands where 1007 nodes are located. Some of them are:

```{r}
data_table <- edges %>%
  filter(END_ID == "14025646")%>%
  inner_join(nodes, by = c("START_ID"="node_id"))%>%
  select(START_ID, name, countries, status, type)%>%
  rename("node" = START_ID, "Country"=countries)%>%
  group_by(type)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(top_n(data_table, 5, name))
```

All nodes located here are Officer type and with NA`s status.


### Node 10200346 (Entity).


The entity with more conections is the "10200346", named ACCELONIC LTD. with 1007 connections.

```{r}
data_table <- edges %>%
  filter(END_ID == "10200346")%>%
  inner_join(nodes, by = c("START_ID"="node_id"))%>%
  select(START_ID, name, countries, status, type)%>%
  rename("node" = START_ID, "Country"=countries)%>%
  group_by(type)
```

Some of the conections are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(top_n(data_table, 5, name), caption = "Node 10200346 connections")
```

This Entity has one Intermediary that is the node "11003761" located in Hong Kong and 1006 Officers, most of the located in United States. At the moment the entity status is Defaulted.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot <- as.data.frame(table(data_table$Country))

ggplot(plot, aes(x="", y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = " ",
    y = " ",
    fill = "Country",
    title = "Distribution by country") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_blank())

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(top_n(plot,5,Freq), col.names = c("Country", "Freq"))
```

This graphic shows the distribution by country of Officers associated with the node. As we can see most of them are located in U.S.A. but there are some of them located all around the world. 


### Node 11001746 (Intermediary).


The Intermediary with more connections is the "11001746" called ORION HOUSE SERVICES (HK) LIMITED located in Hong Kong with 7016. The intermediary is still ACTIVE.

```{r}
data_table <- edges %>%
  filter(START_ID == "11001746")%>%
  inner_join(nodes, by = c("END_ID"="node_id"))%>%
  select(END_ID, name, countries, status, type)%>%
  rename("node" = END_ID, "Country" = countries)%>%
  group_by(type)
```

Some of the connections of this node are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(top_n(data_table, 5, name))
```

All the connections are Entities located in Hong Kong.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot <- as.data.frame(table(data_table$status))

ggplot(plot, aes(x="", y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = " ",
    y = " ",
    fill = "Country",
    title = "Distribution by status") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_blank())

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(plot, col.names = c("Country", "Freq"))
```

This graphic shows the status distribution of the Entities associated with this node. As we can see more than 50% of them are still Active.

### Node 12160432 (Officer).


The most active Officer is the node "12160432" called MOSSFON SUBSCRIBERS LTD. located in Samoa with 3883 connections.

```{r}
data_table <- edges %>%
  filter(START_ID == "12160432")%>%
  inner_join(nodes, by = c("END_ID" = "node_id"))%>%
  select(END_ID, name, countries, status, type)%>%
  rename("node" = END_ID, "Country" = countries)%>%
  group_by(type)
```

Some of the conncections with this node are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(top_n(data_table, 5, name))
```

This node has one Address and 3882 Entities associated. The Address is on node "14048584" and correspond with the Level "5 Development; Bank of Samoa Building; Beach Road0; Apia; Samoa" where there are other 84 Entities registered.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot <- as.data.frame(table(data_table$status))

ggplot(plot, aes(x="", y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = " ",
    y = " ",
    fill = "Country",
    title = "Distribution of status") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_blank())

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(plot, col.names = c("status", "Freq"))
```

This graphic shows the distribution of Entities associated with the node by status. As we can see, more than 50% are still Active.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot <- as.data.frame(table(data_table$Country))

ggplot(plot, aes(x="", y = Freq, fill = Var1)) +
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = " ",
    y = " ",
    fill = "Country",
    title = "Distribution by country") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_blank())

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(top_n(plot,5,Freq), col.names = c("Country", "Freq"))
```

This graphic shows the distribution of nodes associated with the node by country. As we can see, most of them are located in Hong Kong but there are some of them all around the world.


#Cosiderations

Obviusly, this data set is made for build a network but with the resources and knowledge we have was imposible to build it.
